# Research Questions / Hypotheses:
## Hypothesis 1
We hypothesize that climate and economic conditions in Chile have a measurable impact on copper production. Specifically, we investigate how El Niño events (as captured by the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)), annual temperature, precipitation, inflation, and GDP growth in Chile correlate with variations in national copper output.

## Hypothesis 2
We further hypothesize that changes in global copper production and demand influence global copper prices. Given Chile’s position as the world’s largest copper producer, production shifts—especially those driven by climate and macroeconomic shocks—may contribute to observable movements in international copper markets.

# Analysis Plan:
1.We compile and clean monthly and annual data on Chile’s copper production alongside local climate indicators (ONI, temperature, precipitation) and economic metrics (inflation, GDP growth). 
2. Through linear regression model, correlation analysis and the associated lag analysis, we examine how these factors affect copper output over time. (To support this, we also visualize geographic patterns of production and temperature shifts during El Niño years to illustrate the transmission channels from climate to market.)
3. We then analyze how fluctuations in Chilean production relate to global copper prices, aiming to uncover potential climate- and macro-driven pathways from regional production to international market impact.
